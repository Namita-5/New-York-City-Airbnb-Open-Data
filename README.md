# In this project, I would like to choose the best prediction model for price.

AirBnB acts as a broker between listing owners and customers. It sets up prices of listing according to multiple parameters and provides independence to listing owners to decide their own prices. However, with growing business , it would be a better idea if AirBnB can help new owners registering into portal with estimating prices that could enable them more customers and also provide affordable accomodation options to customers. We will build up a model which on basis of past pattern sets up smart pricing mechanism.
